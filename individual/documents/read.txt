I based my work on the HTML, CSS and JS from the previous activity but added PHP
The main page (index.php) is my Faculty Intern Dashboard where the courses show up as cards. 
I added a form on that page that allows someone to register a new course and send the info to another PHP page (register.php).

Files I used:
- index.php → main dashboard and form page
- register.php → displays the form data
- style.css → my design from the previous activity
- script.js → adds the dynamic course cards
